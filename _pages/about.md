I'm a second year MS student of [Stanford Mechnical Engineering Department](https://me.stanford.edu/), advised by Dr. [Mac Schwager](https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/) and Dr. [Monroe Kennedy III](https://me.stanford.edu/people/monroe-kennedy). I am interested in areas aligned with my background, including **reinforcement learning**, **traditional control methods** (PID, LQR, MPC, etc.), **mobile robotics**, and **vision-language-action(VLA)** models. Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, cooking, basketball (Kyrie Irving is my idol), fitness, board games, and video games. My highest in-game rankings include: TFT (NA top 800), Golden Spatula (top 200), Hearthstone Battlegrounds 9000+, and Honor of Kings 30+ stars. 

**I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from UIUC in 2024.** During my undergraduate studies, I graduated with the **highest honor** in my major and **co-founded** our robotics club, [IRM](https://github.com/illini-robomaster), which grew to over 20 members. I served as the club’s vice president as well as the deputy lead of the electrical control team. In both my junior and senior years, I received the departmental scholarship—awarded to only **2–3 students** out of roughly 2,600 each year. My [senior design](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ece445/hall-of-fame.asp)(Fall 2023) was also ranked **first** among 40 projects in my cohort. I was just one Bronze Tablet away from achieving a complete sweep of all university honors.

My Curriculum Vitae can be found here([English](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ZD5Vrq-KzRyAAhngjY0aDPF-agwOLZY/view?usp=sharing)/[Chinese]()) (updated Nov.20, 2025).
